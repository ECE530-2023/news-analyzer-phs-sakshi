Our mission is to provide users with a simple, user-friendly platform for storing and analyzing documents, and to provide insights into their sentiment, keywords, and more.

    </p><p>The project was initially developed as a part of the course EC-530 Software Engineering Principles. It is built on the latest technologies and best practices in software engineering, making it a reliable and efficient tool for document analysis.

        With News Analyzer Project, you can upload your documents, process them for analysis, and get valuable insights into the document's content. The application is powered by AWS S3, which enables efficient storage of documents, and our keyword search and sentiment analysis features provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the document's context.

        In addition to these features, we also offer a word definition tool that can help you quickly look up the meaning of any word in your document.

</p><p>If you have any questions, feedback, or need support, please do not hesitate to contact us at phsakshi@bu.edu. We are committed to providing our users with the best possible experience and are always open to suggestions on how we can improve the application.</p>
